# Wind Language
This will be both an original language, using simple function names that it’s easy to know what they do, such as “print()”, “getUserInput()”, etc. It will normally convert to Java code, but there will also be an extension for it where it can convert to multiple different other languages, such as C, MIPS, Python, and x86.

The functions won’t necessarily be one-to-one with Java functions, either. For instance, “String x = getUserInput()” will be all you would have to do in this language, whereas it would convert to convention in Java (Using Scanner, etc.).

And, since object-oriented programming is basically enacted on by pointers, this language will support both object-oriented programming and pointer-based programming, so the user can be comfortable coding with the type of programming he’s used to, just simpler programming.
